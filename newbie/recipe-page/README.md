## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- css-properties
- Scss


### What I learned

Well, what I did learn? The answer must be working better with the list-element as ul, ol. My default reaction to them is usually by disable them. However this time it was require to work with them. I don't think I nailed it completely, and will try to developing learning them in the future.

### Continued development
Styling list items
