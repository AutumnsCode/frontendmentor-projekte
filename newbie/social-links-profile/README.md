## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- sass

### What I learned

Well, it wasn't as easy as I thought, it would be. Not the HTML part, but the scss part took longer than I thought it be. 
However, it was a lot of fun


### Continued development

Well, I like to improve how to add attribution section, without it overflow by smaller sizes
